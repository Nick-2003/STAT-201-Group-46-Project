    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Background Information\n",
    "From 2010 to 2013, substantial parts of China have suffered from chronic air pollution. The main pollutants are PM2.5, otherwise known as particulate matter, referring to tiny particles in the air with aerodynamic diameters of $2.5$ micrometers ($2.5 \\mu m$) or less. PM2.5 consists of a complex mixture of solids and aerosols, with particles containing various organic and inorganic compounds. (Inhalable Particulate Matter and Health (PM2.5 and PM10)) \n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of high concentrations of PM2.5 in China has negatively influenced the climate, visibility, and human health, with the most notable case being the Eastern China smog outbreak in December 2013, where PM2.5 levels reached as high as $507$ micrograms per cubic metre ($507 \\mu g/m^3$). (Con Gen ShanghaiAir, 2013) In 2013, in an attempt to reduce air pollution, the Chinese government issued the 2013-2017 Clear Air Action Plan, aiming to significantly reduce the concentrations of PM2.5 in China by 2017. (Andrews-Speed, P., Shobert., B. A., Zhidong, L., &amp; Herberg, M. E., 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset and Project Question\n",
    "For our research project, we have selected datasets of hourly observations of PM2.5 concentration from 1-1-2013 to 12-31-2015. These datasets were retrieved from the [PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/PM2.5+Data+of+Five+Chinese+Cities) from UCI machine learning repository, and converted from a singular RAR file to CSV files online. The datasets contain PM2.5 data in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang, along with other meteorological data for each city, from 2013 to 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project question is: \"Given the sample data for cities in China, is there a significant decrease in PM2.5 concentration in the cities in China between 2013 and 2015?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the project question, let $\\mu_{2013}$ be the mean PM2.5 concentration in 2013 measured in $\\mu_{2013}$ $g/m^3$, $\\mu_{2015}$ be the mean PM2.5 concentration in 2015 measured in $\\mu_{2015}$ $g/m^3$, $\\sigma_{2013}$ be the standard deviation of the PM2.5 concentration in 2013 measured in $\\sigma_{2013}$ $g/m^3$, and $\\sigma_{2015}$ be the standard deviation of the PM2.5 concentration in 2015 measured in $\\sigma_{2015}$ $g/m^3$. The following hypothesis tests will be conducted: \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis test 1:\n",
    "$$H_0: \\mu_{2013} = \\mu_{2015}$$ \n",
    "$$H_1: \\mu_{2013} > \\mu_{2015}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis test 2:\n",
    "$$H_0: \\sigma_{2013} = \\sigma_{2015}$$ \n",
    "$$H_1: \\sigma_{2013} \\neq \\sigma_{2015}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Generalisations based on sample -->\n",
    "<!-- Differences in locations -->\n",

    "So far, we have examined the gross difference in air quality between 2013 and 2015 for 5 cities in China. Although this may give us an idea on how air quality has changed in these cities, we cannot know with our preliminary results if the calculated differences are statistically significant, and if we can reject the null hypothesis, increasing the risk of committing type I and II errors. For our results to be more trustworthy, a hypothesis test with a 0.05 significance level would be necessary, and thus will be implemented in future steps of this study. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the policy intervention of the 2013-2017 Clear Air Action Plan, we anticipate a substantial improvement in the air quality of at least three out of the five cities in our study (i.e., a majority of the cities). This improvement would be reflected in a significant reduction in PM2.5 levels, indicating that the policy has effectively addressed the air quality issues in these cities. Such an outcome would have far-reaching implications for public health and environmental sustainability in the region, as it would indicate that targeted policy interventions can indeed make a significant impact in mitigating air pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the real-life impacts of air quality policies. If our null hypothesis ($\\mu_{2013} = \\mu_{2015}$) is not rejected, our findings could serve as a wake-up call for policymakers to develop more effective policies to address the critical issue of air quality in China. By highlighting the severe health and environmental consequences of poor air quality, such as increased respiratory illnesses, environmental damage, economic costs, and social inequality, our study can drive the development of more targeted and effective policies to improve air quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our research findings hold significant implications for several critical areas such as public health and the environment. Our study has the potential to address key questions that could help shape future policy decisions. These questions include:\n",
    "- How can policymakers create more effective policies to improve air quality in China?\n",
    "- What are the reasons for the inefficacy of current policies aimed at improving air quality in China?\n",
    "- In what ways can policymakers continue to improve air quality, given the success or failure of current policies?\n",
    "- Can the policies implemented in China be scaled and replicated in other cities or countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these crucial questions, our study could guide policymakers to design and implement effective strategies to tackle air pollution and its impacts, not just in China but across the globe."
